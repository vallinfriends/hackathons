        There are many benefits to supporting local businesses, both for the
        businesses and the customers.
      </p>
      <!-- Stronger Community -->
      <b><p>Stronger Community</p></b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Local businesses tend to donate more to nonprofits than nonlocal
          owners.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stronger relationships can be built between local business employees
          and regular customers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <!-- Economic Growth -->
      <b><p>Economic Growth</p></b>
      <ul>
        <li>Local businesses provide the most new jobs.</li>
        <li>
          Buying from local businesses keeps more money in the community, as
          many local businesses buy from other local businesses.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Better Shopping Experience -->
      <b><p>Better Shopping Experience</p></b>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You get better customer service, as the employees typically have more
          specific expertise in their product areas.
        </li>
        <li>
          You'll get more customized products/services, as customer desires and
          values matter more in small, local businesses.
        </li>
      </ul>
